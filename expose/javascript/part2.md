1. it will output the value of i which=3. Since var is funciton scope, it can be access at anywhere in the function.
2. it will output the value of discountedPrice which is 150. Since var is funciton scope, it can be access at anywhere in the function.
3. it will output the value of finalPrice which is 150.
4. it will return an array [50,100,150]. Since the function store each discounted price in the array.
5. Error since i is undefine, out of scope from the for block
6. Error since discountedPrice is undefine, out of scope from the for block

8. it will return an array [50,100,150]. Since the function store each discounted price in the array.
9. Error since i is undefine, out of scope from the for block
10. it will output the value of length which=3
11. it will return an array [50,100,150]. discounted can be pushed to since const only make it can't points to other element.
12. A) student.name   
 B) student["Grad Year"]   
 C) student.greeting()   
 D) student["Favorite Teacher"].name

14. A) 32 since 2 convert to string   
 B) 1 since '3' convert to number   
 C) 3 since null converts to 0    
 D) 4 since true convert to 1
 E) 4 since true convert to false  
 F) 0 since false convert to 0    
 G)3undefined since undefine cvt to string    
 H) NaN since 3-NaN=NaN
14. A) True since '2' convert to 2
B) True since they convert to number
C) True '2' convert to 2
D) False since true convert to 1
E) true since Boolean(2) is true
15. == compare the value, ===compare both type and value

17. It will return [2,4,6]. For each element, call doSomething to mulitiply by 2 and store results.
